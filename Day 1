Today was the Day1 of my 100 Days of Code.
I learnt a lot of new things in python like:
        1. Print statement
                   print("Hello World")
                           Hello World
        2. String Concatination
                   #String Concatination
                   print("Hello"+" "+"Ronit")
                           Hello Ronit
        3. Input function
                  #Input Function
                  name = input("What is your name?\n")
        4. Specifying a data type of input
        5. Combining print and input statement
                  #Combining print and input statement
                  print("Hello" + ' ' + input("Enter your name: "))
                          Enter your name: Ronit
                          Hello Ronit
        6. Variables
        7. Length function
                  #Checking the length of a variable
                  a = input("Enter your name: ")
                  print(a,len(a))
                          Enter your name: ronit
                          ronit 5
        8. Final Project for the day was a pet Band Name Generator
                  #Final project for the day
                  print("Welcome to Band name generator")
                  a = input("""Enter the name of city in which you grew up
                            """)
                  b= input("""Enter your pet name
                           """)
                  print(f"Your band name could be: {a} {b}")
                          Welcome to Band name generator
                          Enter the name of city in which you grew up
                                  chicago
                          Enter your pet name
                                  brabby
                          Your band name could be: chicago brabby
