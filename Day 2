Today was Day2 of my python learning journey
I learnt a lot of new things like:
        1. Data Types: Intergers,Floating value numbers, booleaan,type conversion,many different mathmatical operators and the use of f string.
Project for the Day: Tip Calculator
        import time as t
        t.sleep(2)
        print("Welcome to te tip calculator")
        t.sleep(2)
        bill = int(input("What was your total bill? "))
        tip = int(input("How much tip you can give? (10%, 12% or 15%) "))
        people = int(input("How many people will split the bill? "))
        total_bill = bill+((tip/100)*bill) 
        bill_per_person = total_bill/people
        t.sleep(2)
        print("Your total bill is: ",bill_per_person)
                Output:
                       Welcome to te tip calculator
                       What was your total bill? 300
                       How much tip you can give? (10%, 12% or 15%) 10
                       How many people will split the bill? 6
                       Your total bill is:  55.0
